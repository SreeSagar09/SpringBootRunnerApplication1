A Program to implement custom runner by using CommandLineRunner interface:
Programs:
* SpringBootRunnerApplication1Application.java
* CustomCommandLineRunner.java
Notes:
* In Spring Boot application custom runners can be implemented by using CommandLineRunner, ApplicationRunner interfaces
* In this application custom runner is implemented by using CommandLineRunner interface.
* The CommandLineRunner interface extends the Runner interface, the Runner interface is a Marker interface. 
* The CommanLineRunner interface is a Functional Interface, and its run(String... args) is a functional method.
* We can create multiple custom runners in same application context, and we can ordered by using Ordered interface or @Order annotation.
Output:
From run method in CustomRunner class.
From main method in SpringBootRunnerApplication1Application class.
